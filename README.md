# MultiLayerPerceptron

There is my MultiLayer Perceptron implementation written in numpy.
MultiLayer Perceptron is a widely used neural network, which consist of one input layer, a few hidden layers and one output layer. Unlike Perceptron, MLP can
be used to classify sets which are not linearly separated.

# Installation
You can install all dependencies with:

```
$ pip install -r requirements.py
```

### Python libraries used in project
Project is created with:
* numpy 1.19.5
* scikit-learn 0.24.1 which provides datasets.

# How to use
You can create model and add new layers. There is a few activation and cost functions. There is also accuracy score and cross validation to
check your model performance.
