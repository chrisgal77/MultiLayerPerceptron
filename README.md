# MultiLayerPerceptron

There is my MultiLayer Perceptron implementation written in numpy.
MultiLayer Perceptron is a widely used neural network, which consist of one input layer, a few hidden layers and one output layer. Unlike Perceptron, MLP can
be used to classify sets which are not linearly separated.

## Python libraries used in project
Project is created with:
* numpy 1.19.5
* scikit-learn 0.24.1 which provides datasets.
